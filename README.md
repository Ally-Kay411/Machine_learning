# Unsupervised Learning 
Segmenting Shopping Mall Customers
* Use a simulated dataset of 200 shopping mall customers.
* Each customer record consists of a unique identifier (CustomerID), gender
(Gender), age (Age), annual salary (Income), and an assigned score, between 1 and 100,
based on the customer’s purchase habits and several other factors (SpendingScore).
### What is the goal?
The goal is to segment customers based on Income and SpendingScore. The data is found in
the file “mallcustomers.csv”. From that the mall owners/managers can decide how to best organize stores and how to advertise.
